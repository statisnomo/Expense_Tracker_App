I've tried learning basic Flutter, but it will require a lot more time to get the hang of it.
There are still fixes to be made to make the application functional, and I have just uploaded whatever I have done till now.
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
I've managed to link a Firebase backup but it still needs refinement.

Thank you,
